# Claude Code Instructions – Todo Phase II

## Development Style
Use spec-driven development only.
Always read files inside /specs before generating implementation.

## Rules
- Do not write manual code directly
- Follow specs for features, API, database, and architecture
- Keep frontend and backend aligned with specs
- Generate code based on specs only

## Project Structure
- /specs contains all feature and system specifications
- Implementation should follow these specs strictly
